            <h2>Brain Tumor Classifier</h2>
            <p>This was a final project for ECS 170: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at UC Davis. Our team was able to build a convolutional neural network that could accurately identify the type of tumor present in a brain image, among glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.</p>
            <p>We were able to reach full accuracy using Keras to compile and train our model. I was responsible for researching preliminary datasets, writing preprocessing code, and debugging our data generation method to create augmented data for more training rounds.</p>

            <h2>SkyNote Landing Page</h2>
            <p>This was my first introduction to web design, which took place during an internship for a machine-learning based music education app. I had little previous experience with HTML and CSS, and had to learn from the existing code and online resources.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest lessons I learned through this project was the importance of responsive web design, and ensuring that the site was user friendly regardless of screen size. I also would have liked to incorporate more design principles to enhance the site.</p>

            <h2>Neurotech Talk</h2>
            <p>Neurotech Talk is a neurotechnology focused podcast, discussing a wide range of topics from brain computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, and philosophy.</p>
            <p>This project was spearheaded by the publications team that I lead at Neurotech@Davis. We had no previous experience with recording podcasts, but managed to work our way up to interviewing professors and professionals within the field of technology and neuroscience.</p>

            <h2>Article: "Brain Chips and Robotic Arms: How BCI technology is providing movement to the physically disabled"</h2>
            <p>This article was the final assignment for my UWP 101 course at UC Davis, and was later published by Neurotech@Davis. It explores the impacts of brain computer interfaces for disabled individuals, and provides an overview of the technology.</p>
