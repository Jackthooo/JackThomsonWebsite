            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <p>This website serves as an opportunity to address the issues present in the SkyNote landing page. I wanted to create a simple website using what I have learned in my responsive web development course (freeCodeCamp), before learning more about JavaScript and front-end libraries. I prefer to solidify the skills I am developing rather than incorporate more flashy components at the expense of usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.</p>
            <p>Although I believe this website serves its purpose in informing users about myself and the work I have done, I hope to incorporate what I learn in the future about design and programming to enhance the site.</p>

            <h2>SkyNote Landing Page</h2>
            <p>This was my first web development project, aimed at redesigning a website for a machine-learning based music education app. During my internship, I was shown the existing code, and learned by examining what each component does using online resources. There was a huge learning curve, but I became more comfortable with HTML and CSS through it. </p>
            <p>That being said, there were many issues with the website remaining when my internship ended. I had completely neglected the concept of responsiveness, and when reviewing the website on other screens I saw that my code was unorganized, and I had used a mix of incompatible display properties. The margins and paddings had been adjusted solely for my screen, which caused lots of responsiveness issues. </p>
            <p>Despite these problems, I was proud of the use of CSS to create an iPhone frame around a recording of the app in action, and my overall progress over the six-week internship after coming in with no previous web development experience.</p>

            <h2>Article: "The Emergence of Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression"</h2>
            <p>This was the first article I wrote for Neurotech@Davis. I chose this topic due to my own struggles with depression, and the increasing mental-health concerns associated with the pandemic and the resulting lockdown.</p>
            <p>This also ignited my passion for neurotechnology, and introduced me to the community of Neurotech@Davis. Ultimately, my responsibility and writing landed me the role of co-head of the publications division, a role I still hold today.</p>

            <h2>Article: "Brain Chips and Robotic Arms: How BCI technology is providing movement to the physically disabled"</h2>
            <p>This article was the final project in my UWP 101 course at UC Davis (Advanced Composition), also published for Neurotech@Davis. Our assignment was to create a scientific blog post on a topic of our choice. Of course I chose neurotechnology, specifically the use of brain-computer interfaces in the restoration of movement in spinal cord injury patients. </p>
            <p>This article resulted in an A+ in the class, which I was proud of, since this class exposed me to my own writing flaws that I had to break down and reconstruct. I learned alot about self-criticism, and the ability to grow from feedback from myself and others.</p>

            <h2>Neurotech Talk</h2>
            <p>This is a podcast in the works with my fellow co-heads of the publications division and a group of our members.</p>
            <p>We created this podcast to allow more access to the field of neurotechnology by discussing topics with individuals and professionals in the field. Our pilot epiode was recorded with the head of our projects divison, who teaches a curriculum on neurotechnology and assists members in building brain-computer interfaces.</p>
            <p>This was a trial episode, as we figured out how (and how not to) record, navigated our limited access to recording materials, and collaborated with individuals knowledgeable in editing to get a feel for the process. In the future, we hope to collaborate with UC Davis neuroengineering faculty and increase audio quality.</p>

            <h2>Neurotech@Davis Medium</h2>
            <p>This medium page contains several articles I have edited and represents the product of my role as co-head of the publications division. These articles display the curiosity of our memebers that I had a part in fostering. </p>
            <p>This role has taught me so much about communicating with others in a team-setting, and my ability to give constructive crticism.</p>
