            <h2>Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 21-year-old from Clovis, CA, currently living in Davis as I complete the last year of my B.S. in cognitive science. When I am not studying, I enjoy listening to and playing music, taking care of my plants, and redecorating my college home with my housemates.</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is an integral part of my life, shaping my experiences and driving my creativity. I began playing the piano in elementary school, and soon found myself tinkering my dad’s acoustic Epiphone he played in the stairwells of UCLA in the 80’s. I played viola in my high school orchestra which sparked my interest in classical music. I continue playing the piano and guitar for my family and friends, and have explored the cello, violin, electric bass, and DJ equipment.</p>
            <p>My taste in music spans several genres, from indie-folk to techno, with some of my favorite artists being Alex G, Adrianne Lenker, Franz Liszt, Lana Del Rey, and Radiohead. Here are some of my favorite and most listened-to albums.</p>

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>When I am able to, I love to travel and expose myself to the nature, culture, and communities that other cities, states, and countries have to offer. In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to intern in the city of Barcelona and experience the bustling streets, welcoming locals, and different customs that I thoroughly enjoyed. I particularly appreciated the laid-back energy of the locals, unburdened by the fast-paced life style common in most US cities. </p>

            <p>Within the US, Washington has been my favorite state to visit. My family and I embarked on a biking trip around the San Juan Islands, surrounded by beautiful scenery and wildlife (the whales were magnificent, but the rabbits on Whidbey Island were magical). </p>

            <p>Despite the amazing world beyond California, this state will always hold a spot in my heart. Although I am glad to have broadened my horizons past Clovis, the backdrop of the Sierras present in the valley’s sprawling fields and orchards contains an undeniable beauty. From the thriving art community in the nearby Downtown Fresno area, to the active LGBTQ+ community in San Francisco where I feel unconditionally embraced, I feel a deep appreciation to have grown up in this state. </p>
